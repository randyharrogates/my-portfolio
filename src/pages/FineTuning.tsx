					<p className="lead">
						<i className="bi bi-file-earmark-text me-2"></i>
						This project involved fine-tuning a BERT-based model, specifically designed for medical data, to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER). The task focused on identifying medical
						entities such as diseases, treatments, and medications within clinical notes. The fine-tuning process was carried out using FastAPI as the backend and was deployed within a
						Kedro pipeline.

					</h4>
					<p>
						<i className="bi bi-lightbulb me-2"></i>
						In addition to fine-tuning the BERT-based model, we employed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the modelâ€™s performance in identifying and understanding more
						complex medical terms. RAG, when combined with LLMs, allows the system to leverage external knowledge sources (such as clinical literature) during the inference process. This
						combination has significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of Named Entity Recognition (NER) within medical texts.
